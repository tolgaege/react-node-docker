## Building the project

### Configuring TypeScript compilation
TypeScript uses the file `tsconfig.json` to adjust project compile options.
Let's dissect this project's `tsconfig.json`, starting with the `compilerOptions` which details how your project is compiled.
```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "target": "es6",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
        "*": [
            "node_modules/*",
            "src/types/*"
        ]
    }
},
```

| `compilerOptions` | Description |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"module": "commonjs"`             | The **output** module type (in your `.js` files). Node uses commonjs, so that is what we use            |
| `"esModuleInterop": true,`         | Allows usage of an alternate module import syntax: `import foo from 'foo';`                            |
| `"target": "es6"`                  | The output language level. Node supports ES6, so we can target that here                               |
| `"noImplicitAny": true`            | Enables a stricter setting which throws errors when something has a default `any` value                |
| `"moduleResolution": "node"`       | TypeScript attempts to mimic Node's module resolution strategy. Read more [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#node)                                                                    |
| `"sourceMap": true`                | We want source maps to be output along side our JavaScript. See the [debugging](#debugging) section    |
| `"outDir": "dist"`                 | Location to output `.js` files after compilation                                                        |
| `"baseUrl": "."`                   | Part of configuring module resolution. See [path mapping section](#installing-dts-files-from-definitelytyped) |
| `paths: {...}`                     | Part of configuring module resolution. See [path mapping section](#installing-dts-files-from-definitelytyped) |

### Running the build

| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-sass`, `build-ts`, `lint`, `copy-static-assets`)       |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch-node`              | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes. Used in the main watch task         |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Sass, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `watch-test`              | Runs tests in watch mode                                                                          |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                                 |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                |
| `build-sass`              | Compiles all `.scss` files to `.css` files                                                          |
| `watch-sass`              | Same as `build-sass` but continuously watches `.scss` files and re-compiles when needed            |
| `lint`                    | Runs ESLint on project files                                                                       |
| `copy-static-assets`      | Calls script that copies JS libs, fonts, and images to dist directory                             |
| `debug`                   | Performs a full build and then serves the app in watch mode                                       |
| `serve-debug`             | Runs the app with the --inspect flag                                                               |
| `watch-debug`             | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger                   |

## Type Definition (`.d.ts`) Files

In general if you stick to the following steps you should have minimal `.d.ts` issues;
1. After installing any npm package as a dependency or dev dependency, immediately try to install the `.d.ts` file via `@types`.
2. If the library has a `.d.ts` file on DefinitelyTyped, the install will succeed and you are done.
If the install fails because the package doesn't exist, continue to step 3.
3. Make sure you project is [configured for supplying your own `d.ts` files](#setting-up-typescript-to-look-for-dts-files-in-another-folder)
4. Try to [generate a `.d.ts` file with dts-gen](#using-dts-gen).
If it succeeds, you are done.
If not, continue to step 5.
5. Create a file called `<some-library>.d.ts` in your `types` folder.
6. Add the following code:
```ts
declare module "<some-library>";
```
7. At this point everything should compile with no errors and you can either improve the types in the `.d.ts` file by following this [guide on authoring `.d.ts` files](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) or continue with no types.
8. If you are still having issues, let me know by sending me an email or pinging me on twitter, I will help you.

## Testing
For this project, I chose [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as our test framework.
While Mocha is probably more common, Mocha seems to be looking for a new maintainer and setting up TypeScript testing in Jest is wicked simple.

### Install the components
To add TypeScript + Jest support, first install a few npm packages:
```
npm install -D jest ts-jest
```
`jest` is the testing framework itself, and `ts-jest` is just a simple function to make running TypeScript tests a little easier.

### Configure Jest
Jest's configuration lives in `jest.config.js`, so let's open it up and add the following code:
```js
module.exports = {
    globals: {
        'ts-jest': {
            tsConfigFile: 'tsconfig.json'
        }
    },
    moduleFileExtensions: [
        'ts',
        'js'
    ],
    transform: {
        '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': './node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js'
    },
    testMatch: [
        '**/test/**/*.test.(ts|js)'
    ],
    testEnvironment: 'node'
};
```
Basically we are telling Jest that we want it to consume all files that match the pattern `"**/test/**/*.test.(ts|js)"` (all `.test.ts`/`.test.js` files in the `test` folder), but we want to preprocess the `.ts` files first.
This preprocess step is very flexible, but in our case, we just want to compile our TypeScript to JavaScript using our `tsconfig.json`.
This all happens in memory when you run the tests, so there are no output `.js` test files for you to manage.

### Running tests
Simply run `npm run test`.
Note this will also generate a coverage report.

### Writing tests
Writing tests for web apps has entire books dedicated to it and best practices are strongly influenced by personal style, so I'm deliberately avoiding discussing how or when to write tests in this guide.
However, if prescriptive guidance on testing is something that you're interested in, [let me know](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LN2CV82), I'll do some homework and get back to you.

## ESLint
ESLint is a code linter which mainly helps catch quickly minor code quality and style issues.

### ESLint rules
Like most linters, ESLint has a wide set of configurable rules as well as support for custom rule sets.
All rules are configured through `.eslintrc` configuration file.
In this project, we are using a fairly basic set of rules with no additional custom rules.

### Running ESLint
Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke ESLint.
To run ESLint you can call the main build script or just the ESLint task.
```
npm run build   // runs full build including ESLint
npm run lint    // runs only ESLint
```
Notice that ESLint is not a part of the main watch task.

If you are interested in seeing ESLint feedback as soon as possible, I strongly recommend the [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
